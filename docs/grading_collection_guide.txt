GRADING STRUCTURE DATA COLLECTION GUIDE
================================================================================

PURPOSE
-------
Collect grading breakdown information for UC Berkeley CS/DATA courses to use
as features for predicting course difficulty and grade distributions.

FILES
-----
- data/course_websites.csv: List of course websites
- data/grading_structure.csv: Template for recording grading data

WHAT TO COLLECT
---------------
For each course, find the following from the course syllabus/website:

1. PERCENTAGE BREAKDOWN (should sum to ~100%):
   - pct_exams: % of grade from exams (midterms + finals)
   - pct_projects: % of grade from projects/programming assignments
   - pct_homework: % of grade from homework/problem sets
   - pct_participation: % from participation/attendance/discussion
   - pct_other: % from quizzes, labs, or other assessments

2. ASSESSMENT COUNTS:
   - num_exams: Total number of exams (midterms + final)
   - num_projects: Total number of projects/major assignments
   - num_homeworks: Total number of homework sets

3. FINAL EXAM:
   - has_final_exam: yes/no

4. METADATA:
   - notes: Any special grading policies (e.g., "drops lowest 2 HW")
   - source_url: Direct link to syllabus/grading policy page
   - collection_date: Date you collected this (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - collected: Mark as "yes" when done

HOW TO COLLECT
--------------
1. Open data/course_websites.csv to find course website
2. Visit the course website
3. Look for: "Syllabus", "Course Info", "Policies", or "Grading"
4. Record the grading breakdown in data/grading_structure.csv
5. Mark collected="yes"

TIPS
----
- Use most recent semester available (Fall 2024 or Spring 2025)
- If exact breakdown not available, estimate from course description
- If multiple semesters differ, use most common structure
- Some courses may have different structures per semester - note this
- If you can't find grading info, leave blank and mark collected="attempted"

EXAMPLE: CS 61A
---------------
Website: https://cs61a.org/
Page: https://cs61a.org/articles/about-61a/

Grading breakdown (Fall 2024):
- Homework: 20%
- Projects: 25%
- Midterm 1: 15%
- Midterm 2: 15%
- Final: 25%

Record as:
subject: COMPSCI
number: 61A
pct_exams: 55 (15+15+25)
pct_projects: 25
pct_homework: 20
pct_participation: 0
pct_other: 0
num_exams: 3 (2 midterms + 1 final)
num_projects: 4 (typical)
num_homeworks: ~10-12 (weekly)
has_final_exam: yes
notes: "Drops 1 lowest HW"
source_url: https://cs61a.org/articles/about-61a/
collection_date: 2025-01-01
collected: yes

PRIORITY ORDER
--------------
Focus on high-enrollment courses first (already sorted by enrollment):
1. COMPSCI 61A (18,178 students)
2. DATA C8 (17,779 students)
3. COMPSCI 61B (13,757 students)
... etc

Aim to collect at least 10-12 courses for meaningful modeling.
